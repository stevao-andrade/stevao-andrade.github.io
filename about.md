# About

I am a PhD. student in Computer Science at the [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://www.icmc.usp.br/) of the [University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br/) (USP), Brazil, under the guidance of Prof. [Márcio Delamaro](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2844974351441051), developing researchs in Software Engineering area. 

I am currently working in developing specific test techniques for programs developed in the context of virtual reality. This research topic is in an early stage of development.

I recive my Master's also in ICMC. During the master's I work on parallel algorithms to reduce the effort related to the execution of Mutation Testing. Mutation Testing is a fault–based software testing technique that has been widely studied for over three decades. 

I received my B.Sc. in Information Systems from [Faculty Integral Differential](http://www.facid.edu.br/) (FACID/DeVry).
