## Master's Defense

Finally after more than 2 years ending another cycle.

In the day 08 of April I successfully defended my Master's.

A digital copie of my dissertation (in portuguese) will be avaliable at [Dissertations and Thesis site of the University of SÃ£o Paulo](http://www.teses.usp.br/). In time i also have a paper (in english) under avaliation that describes all the results achived during my master. 

Once the documents were made available i will make another post in order to provide an copy for people who might be interested.

Bellow a picture taken in the day of my defense, from the left to right:
