## Course of software testing


At the beginning of the year we were invited to teach a software testing course at the Federal University of Piaui, in my hometown, Teresina.

The mini-course is intended for students of computing and related fields and general computing professionals who intend to work in Software Engineering with emphasis on software testing. In addition, the mini-course "benefits" professionals in the development of better quality products, offering essential concepts and practices to be applied in the development of a product.

Over the years, several techniques and test criteria have been proposed in the literature, seeking ways to systematize and increase the quality of the test activity. However, when analyzing the curricula of higher academic education in the area of computing, there is a great gap in the practice of teaching content specifically aimed at software testing.

Thus, it is considered necessary to propose activities that aim to disseminate and improve its dissemination, so that its application can be increasingly inserted in both academic and corporate environments.

The mini-course was taught by me, and a friend, Misael. The slides used during the course are avaliable in the section [Presentation section](/presentations.html).

Below a picture with the students at the end of the course.
