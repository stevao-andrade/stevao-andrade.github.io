## Hello World

Hello! 

Recently I created this blog as part of the requirements to successfully completing the course "SCC5933-2 / 1 Scientific Research Methodology in Computer Science".

I will use this space to share my research experiences, as well  all the material produced in this journey.

Finally, I will also use this space to train my English writing skills. Therefore, it is natural to find some typos and perhaps strange sentences.

Feel free to fork this project on my [Github page](https://github.com/stevao-andrade) and suggest corrections.

To know a little bit more about me, please follow to the [about section](/about.html).
